## The idea:
A web app for searching the National Nutritional Database and returns the nutritional information for one or several meals or ingredients. Additional features will be determined during production. Possible features may be Ph levels, salt content, other totals of interest to dietary concerns that may be accomplished without the use of persistent information.

## The challange (motivation):
The challenge of this project was to access the most relevant information from a laypersons input as compared to stored values to query a 12 table database of 30K+ ingredients and 800K+ instances and present it in an easily understandable form to the user. I built this _without prior database knowledge._ Another challenge was to impliment _type-ahead_ a library that allows the app to make input suggestions **without 2 way binding** to help create relevant input.
